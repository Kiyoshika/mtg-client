# MTG Client
This is a custom MTG client (and eventually server) to play Magic: The Gathering online with friends.

Create rooms, build decks and play the card game virtually.

**NOTE:** This is a hobby project done in my spare time so many things are either unfinished or probably broken.

## Frontend
Frontend is written in React + Material UI.

Use `npm run start` for development or `npm run build` to build for production. 

## Backend
The backend is not started yet but will be written with either C# or Java Springboot.
